Tech guy that has been in the game for about a decade.  I work primarily with Microsoft Technologies, mostly Hyper-V, the Systems Center Suite, and a ton of PowerShell.

I am also an avid homebrewer and I am always trying to bring more tech into that space.  In my blog you will always find posts about gadgets and contraptions I am making to assist in brewing.
